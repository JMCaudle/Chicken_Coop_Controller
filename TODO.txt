  -BatteryCurrent
  -DoorSensors

Max-Min for UpDown Elements

Would like to graph Power values over time
  -State of Charge
  -Power produced
  -Power Consumed
  -maybe voltage
  -maybe peak Power production per day

Setup system to track accuracy of SoC predictions, and adjust parameters accordingly

Modify General Panel to suite IRL needs
  -most relevant DataPoints
  -possibly move over mainLight control

Build out settings tab
    -eventually a button to change wifi login
    -maybe also a way to manually set time
    -A confirmation feature for resetting to defaults and other dangerous functions
